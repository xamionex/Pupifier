Lets you become a slugpup in Rain World with a push of a button (dynamic in-game transform), with meadow support. This mod was made specifically for meadow but works for non-meadow as well

Known issues

- Meadow issues are not related to my mod (grabbing players and breaking if you go thru a pipe, piggybacking desync)
- Report any issues please!

Features

- Transform into a slugpup (Works in Rain Meadow)
- Change your stats based on slugpup relativity
- Works with modded slugcats as wellCredits

Steam doesn't give me notifications for comments on my own mods for some reason,
so I might not see your comment because I need to literally go to the mod page to see it, and I'm not doing that every day.
