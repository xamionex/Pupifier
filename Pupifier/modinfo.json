Known issues

- Meadow issues (not related to my mod): 
grabbing players and breaking if you go thru a pipe, piggybacking desync
- Meadow Gamemode: Not working; henpemaz has coded it so that pups are not allowed in the meadow gamemode
      
Features

- Transform into a slugpup dynamically, also works in Meadow
- Change your stats based on slugpup relativity

Steam doesn't give me notifications for comments on my own mods for some reason,
so I might not see your comment because I need to literally go to the mod page to see it, and I'm not doing that every day.
