# Pupifier
Lets you become a slugpup in Rain World with a push of a button (dynamic in-game transform), with meadow support.
This mod was made specifically for meadow but works for non-meadow as well

## Known issues

- Meadow issues (not related to my mod): grabbing players and breaking if you go thru a pipe, piggybacking desync
    - If you don't want these to happen there is a toggle in the remix menu to disable people from grabbing you
- Meadow Gamemode: Not working; henpemaz has coded it so that pups are not allowed in the meadow gamemode, enable locally in toggles settings

## Features

- Transform into a slugpup dynamically, with a hotkey, even when in-game, also works in Meadow
- Change your stats based on slugpup relativity, works with modded slugcats
- Supports controller input as a hotkey to change

## Q&amp;A
- Does this mod change gameplay? Yes, and a ton, you will behave almost like a slugpup, with some changes, for example, it's all relative so if you pick rivulet you will be faster than a normal slugpup
- Is it only cosmetic? No, you could try to make it, I haven't tested much but there is a toggle in the stats settings to turn off changing stats, that way you will still be small but no stats will be changed
- What is configurable? Every stat you have as a player, along with holding double spears as spearmaster or holding 2 items no matter what or not letting people grab you
